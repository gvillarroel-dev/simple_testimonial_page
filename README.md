## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/resources/thumbnail.jpg)

This testimonial page project prioritizes a clean design and authentic presentation over typical promotional layouts. The creation process involved implementing SVG graphics and creating flexible grids for testimonial cards.

The challenge highlighted how thoughtful design decisions influence user trust and credibility in testimonial presentations.

### What I learned

- **SVG Icons Have a Different Impact**: Forget about icon fonts and their loading issues. SVG icons are the best solution, trust me.

- **Flexbox Testimonial Grids Are Flawless**: Arranging testimonial cards to look balanced on any screen size, without awkward gaps or overlaps.

- **Media Queries Aren't Scary**: Creating with mobility first and scaling seems more logical than trying to squeeze desktop layouts onto small screens.

- **Custom List Styling Is Addictive**: Turning simple bullets into elegant checkmarks with CSS pseudo-elements. Way more satisfying than it should be.

- **Testimonial Card Balancing Is an Art**: Getting the perfect combination of quote length and name placement without making it look like a ransom note.

## Built with

- HTML5 semantic elements
- CSS3 flexbox and grid techniques
- Responsive media queries
- Custom pseudo-element styling
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Features

- **Reliable Testimonial Cards**: Realistic-looking testimonials with proper hierarchy, legible quotes, and layouts that convey authenticity.

- **Flexible Card Layouts**: Testimonials are easily rearranged across different viewport sizes, without interruption or clutter.

- **Improved Checklists**: Custom-styled lists and checkmarks integrate seamlessly with the overall design aesthetic.

- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Thoughtful media queries improve the experience on tablets and desktops without sacrificing mobile usability.

Created as part of a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) series that pushed my CSS skills in unexpected directions.
